February #onegameamonth. An RTS with a city builder.

## Running

1. ```git clone```
2. ```npm install```
3. ```grunt``` for dev

## Controls

WASD to move the camera; right-click to tell the creature to move. Creatures will try to survive on their own by eating/sleeping when they get hungry/tired (but you can override this behavior by right-clicking).
